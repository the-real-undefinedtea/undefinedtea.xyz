            <Uses topic="14in MacBook Pro M1 MAX">
              This wonderful machine just replaced a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 9th Generation which I so wanted to like but could not. The M1 is well built, has a great form factor and the display is outstanding. I do miss the keyboard of the ThinkPad, but that is about the only thing i miss at the moment.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="ThinkPad Carbon X1">
              While this is no longer the daily driver for me, I do use it an awful lot still. The keyboard is by far the best keyboard on a laptop I have ever used, combine that with a very custom arch and sway installation and it is just difficult to let this one go entirely.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="Moonlander Mechanical Keyboard">
              No real surprise here I assume, but like most people who spend most of their waking moments in front of a computer, I can not stand anything but a mechanical keyboard. I have had a Rac3 keyboard for the past 5 years now, and I enjoyed everything about it. That was until the moonlander came into my life. Now there is no way back to a non-split keyboard for me.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="MX Master 3">
              I do make an effort to stay on the keyboard as much as possible, but once in a while I just can not. The MX Master 3 is a ratehr standard option as far as peripherals go I think. But as they say: if it ain't broke, do not fix it.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="Brio 4k">
              Since the laptop is mostly neatly stowed away to the side, an external camera is required. Also, can I just say that I do not understand how or why a built-in camera today has the resolution of a potato.

            <Uses topic="i5 7500K 16GB DDR3 1TB SSD 12TB HDD">
              This re-commissioned built from 2015 is the most essential item I own. It provides my entire home lab (which is quite extensive) and I have no idea what I would do without it. The detail of this machine which I call elrond deserves more than just a mention here, so there will be a full length article on this soon.

            <Uses topic="Behringer UMC204HD">
              Not great but not terrible is how I would describe this one. It is really just a place to provide an audio interface to all that fancy stuff listed below.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="Rode Procaster / Rode PSA1 & Rode SM6">
              The aim is to one day host a podcast. In the meanwhile I also gladly use this microphone to stream on twitch.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="Adam Audio T5V">
              Granted I rarely listen to anything without headphones, but when I do I like the sound to be good. These speakers sound great to me and are affordable.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="Bose QC35">
              The noise cancelation on these is fantastic and to me they are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The time to go to the Bose 700 is probably near.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="Loopback">
              A rather crucial (for streaming on twitch for instance) program which I have missed a lot on linux.

            <Uses topic="Vim">
              A year or so ago I made peace with the fact that a customised vim environment is probably not the most effective means for me anymore when it comes to writing code and made a switch to VS Code. I still used vim for some tasks, but not as a daily driver. However, that all changed fairly soon thereafter, and I am back on vim now. As with the server, this too deserves a bit more explanation, so there will be a full length article on this soon.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="iTerm">
              This is the default when it comes to terminal emulator on Apple hardware I think. There is another project called Kitty which has gained some traction recently I think, but there is not really any feature i am missing at the moment from iTerm.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="Tmux">
              I am not sure what to say about tmux. I am not sure where I would be without tmux. I am not sure I would want to life in a world without tmux.

            <Uses topic="Notion">
              Getting (and staying) organised is an endless quest it seems. That is until I found notion. Notion is kind of everything and nothing, so the best way to learn about it is just by using it.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="Todoist">
              It was the fall of 2017 when I went on a youtube spree that lead me to people who spent considerable time to configure todoist to run their life. Naturally I followed along, and whilst I found methods that work for me over the years, I have not looked back since.

              This has replaced Spectacle for me just recently, and so far it does what it is supposed to do. I do not understand why this functionality is (still) not available out of the box on Apple hardware.
